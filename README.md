## Overview

Runtime Video Recorder (RVR) is a production-ready Unreal Engine solution that enables **MP4 video recording at runtime without game or render thread hitches**. Built with performance in mind, it supports hardware-accelerated encoding on Windows (WMF), MacOS (AVFoundation), Oculus/Android (MediaCodec), Linux (OpenH264), and includes specialized features for VR and multi-camera setups.

### Key Features

✨ **Zero Performance Impact**
- Asynchronous encoding on dedicated thread
- No game thread blocking
- Hardware acceleration support (Windows, Mac, Android, Oculus)

🎥 **Flexible Recording Sources**
- Game/Editor viewport recording
- Render target recording
- Single camera recording (Camera & CineCamera)
- Multi-camera grid recording
- 360-degree video support (experimental)

🎵 **Audio Recording**
- Full in-game audio capture
- Selective SoundSubmix recording
- Synchronized audio/video encoding

⚡ **Advanced Features**
- Frame-rate independent recording
- Manual frame capture mode
- Circular buffer (record last N seconds)
- Deferred encoding option
- Real-time camera preview
- Screenshot capture

### Platform Support

## Installation
1. Download from [Google Disk](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vv2RanJ07J2719C7mW-6G6-fQ_oTK391?usp=drive_link)
2. Follow [README](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f9RaY4R70p-AkX3P68co_NG3qvLvSPHDur4j6os_gGY/edit?usp=drive_link)
3. Regenerate project files (right-click `.uproject` → Generate Visual Studio project files)
4. Compile the project
5. Enable the plugin in the editor (Edit → Plugins)

### Dependencies

The plugin automatically enables these required plugins:
- **AudioCapture** - For audio recording functionality
- **ElectraPlayer** - For video playback support

## Troubleshooting

### Recording Not Starting

**Check:**
- Is another recording already in progress? Call `IsRecordingInProgress()`
- Does the output directory exist? Plugin won't create directories
- Are required plugins enabled? (ElectraPlayer, AudioCapture)

### Poor Video Quality

**Solutions:**
- Increase `VideoBitrate` (try 30000000 for 30 Mbps)
- Use `Profile_High` encoder profile
- Set `RCMode` to `RC_Quality`
- Increase `TargetQuality` to 75-90

### Performance Issues

**Solutions:**
- Enable hardware acceleration in Project Settings
- Lower video resolution
- Reduce `TargetFPS`
- Use `bPostponeEncoding = false` (default on-the-fly encoding)
- Disable `bDebugDumpEachFrame`

### Audio Sync Issues

**Check:**
- `bFrameRateIndependent` must be `false` for audio recording
- Ensure game is running at stable framerate
- Try increasing audio buffer size in project audio settings

### Hardware Acceleration Not Working

**Windows:**
- Check GPU drivers are up to date
- Try setting `bForceHardwareAccelerationForAllVendors = true` for AMD/Intel
- Some older GPUs may not support H.264 encoding

**Android:**
- Verify device supports MediaCodec H.264 encoding
- Some emulators don't support hardware encoding
